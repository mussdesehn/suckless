This is an example of bash tool to build a customized LVM management menu.

First, make sure to make menu.sh and lvm_menu.sh executable:
(chmod +x menu.sh lvm_menu.sh).

menu.sh     is used to create a generic menu with smenu
lvm_menu.sh uses menu.sh to create a specialized menu to manage LVM objects

Running lvm_menu.sh -i should display something similar to the screenshot
provided. In this screenshot the user is about to delete a LV.
